Short-term safety profile of COVID-19 booster vaccines in adulte in Australia

Previous publications reporting the safety profiles of the priming doses of COVID-19 vaccines in AUstralia have been purely descriptive. As well as outlining the safety profile of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses in Australia, we aim to provide guidance to medical practitioners on the expected frequency of seeking medical attention for an adverse event following COVID-19 booster vaccine doses for those with 1) common existing medical conditions 2) expected frequency of common adverse events, e.g. fatigue, and 3) expected rates of loss of days of work or study. We will also include expected rates of seeking medical attention following co-administration of other vaccines given at the time of a COVID-19 booster vaccine. As well as the safety profile of Nuvaxovid booster doses, we will be examining the safety profiles of the mRNA vaccine booster doses against strains subsequent to the ancestral strains. Although these particular COVID-19 vaccines are no longer in use, the evi-
dence reported here is likely to contribute to the overall safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines developed using the mRNA or protein-based vaccine platforms.

Included in this repository are R scripts for data cleaning, analysis and graphics generation as well as STAN code for the Bayesian logistic regression analysis.
